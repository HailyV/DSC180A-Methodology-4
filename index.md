## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter was the application of neuro-symbolic AI for biological data interpretation. Learning how ontologies can structure knowledge and reduce hallucinations in large language models provided a strong foundation for reliable and explainable AI systems in biomedical contexts.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate how integrating public biological ontologies (such as Gene Ontology and ChEBI) with neural network models can improve the prediction of off-target drug interactions. The project would explore how ontology-grounded embeddings can enhance interpretability and biological validity in polypharmacology prediction tasks.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In the Quarter 1 project, the focus was primarily on neural models without structured symbolic reasoning. For Quarter 2, I would incorporate ontology-based constraints to ensure logical consistency in model predictions, which could improve both accuracy and explainability. Additionally, I would refine the evaluation metrics to measure biological plausibility, not just numerical performance.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would like to explore knowledge graph embeddings, graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformer-based architectures that integrate symbolic rules. Techniques such as Logic Tensor Networks or DeepProbLog could help fuse symbolic reasoning with neural learning. I’m also interested in experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for structured biological datasets.
