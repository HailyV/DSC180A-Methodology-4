## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter was the one surrounding scraping PubMed for articles, and then trying to see the most probable candidates for drug repurposing. This was interesting to me because I didn't realize a literature study could be used like this to gain information based on what drugs could be possible candidates.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate how integrating public biological ontologies combined with machine learning could be used to reduce risk or maybe find the best drug repurposing candidates. Or something like using regression to reduce the side effects of a certain drug.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In the Quarter 1 project, the focus was primarily on smaller projects to gain more knowledge for the future. I will probably aim to find a bigger goal to work towards, and also explore outside resources such as the ontology websites given. I would also like to incorporate more resources onto my project compared to what was given.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would like to explore knowledge graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformer-based architectures that integrate symbolic rules. However, I am especially interested in regression, which might be a potential topic for next quarter. I am hoping to do less LLM's and focus on that, because I enjoy the process of finding different characteristics to try and better the end goal!
